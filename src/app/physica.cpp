// Hypergraph Symbology
//
// In hypergraph theory, the following symbols and conventions are commonly used:
//
// V: The set of all nodes in the hypergraph.
//    - Example: V = {v1, v2, v3, ..., n}
//
// W: A subset of the node set V.
//    - Example: V = {v1, v2, v3, ..., n}
//               W = {v2, v3}
//
// E: The set of all hyperedges in the hypergraph.
//    - Each hyperedge is itself a subset of the node set V.
//    - Example: E = {e1, e2, e3, ..., n} where each ei is a subset of V
//
// F: A subset of the edge set E.
//    - Example:  E = {e1, e2, e3, ..., n}
//                F = {e2, e3}
//
// v: A single node in the hypergraph
// 
// e: A single edge in the hypergraph
// 
// General Notation:
// - Hypergraphs are often denoted as H = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes
//   and E is the set of hyperedges.
// - A hyperedge e in E is a set of nodes, e.g., e = {v1, v2, v3}.
// - The incidence relation between nodes and hyperedges is fundamental in hypergraph theory.
//
// Usage in Code:
// - std::vector<Node> V;          // The set of all nodes
// - std::vector<Hyperedge> E;     // The set of all hyperedges
// - std::vector<Node> W;          // A subset of nodes
// - std::vector<Hyperedge> F;     // A subset of hyperedges
// - std::weak_ptr<Node> v;        // A single node
// - std::weak_ptr<Hyperedge> e;   // A single edge
//
// This symbology helps in clearly defining the structure and operations of hypergraphs
// in both theoretical discussions and practical implementations.

   // the hypergraph::removeEdge operation. The remove edge operation also handles the
   // removal of the edge from the incidence lists of the nodes on the edge to ensure
   // there are no dangling strong refs and the edge can be properly removed. If a node is
